## Donate

I’m glad to publish these modules for free so anyone can use them. But these modules don’t come cheap for me. Behind every module there are many hours of work (and many litters of coffee). If you enjoy these modules you can support the development by making a donation.

The suggested donation is 20 euro for the full pack, but of course you can donate as much as you want any donation help me buy more coffeeeeee :)

## Use

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/modlfo/VultModules/releases) the file corresponding to the VCVRack version you have. Place the `VultModules` directory in the plugins folder.


## Build

Where did the code go?

I have decided to close the source of some of my new plugins. The reason for closing them is because my new plugins have a very substantial amount of work and research. The nature of my code makes very hard enforce the license terms and the fair use. Even when only some of the modules are closed source, I have removed all the code from the repository in order to avoid confusion when someone compiles the code and some of the modules are not shown.


## License

The license is a BSD 3-Clause with the addition that any commercial use requires explicit permission of the author. That applies for the source code.

For the image resources (all SVG files), any use requires explicit permission of the author.
